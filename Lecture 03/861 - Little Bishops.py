    # The dp[i][j] variable represents the number of ways to place j bishops on the ith diagonal of an n x n chessboard.
    # We create dp and need to acount for j = {0, k+1 (between 0 and k bishops in a diagonal)}

    # Since j=0, there are 0 bishops to place on any diagonal

    # Lastly, for the answer we need to take into account all possible numbers of bishops placed on 
    # either black diagonals (j bishops) or white diagonals (k-j bishops). Thus, we multiply the results 
    # for each scenario (as they are independent), taking into account that the black diagonals (for the n*n chessboard)
    # are 2n-1 and the white ones are 2n-2.
